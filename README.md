# Magnetorotational Instability
Group project for MAE 210C (Fluids III/Hydrodynamic Instability) Spring 2013.


## Topic
Magnetorotational instability:

* [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetorotational_instability)
* Julien and Knobloch (2010): Magnetorotational instability


## Requirements

### Report
* literature review
* 6â€“12 pages
* explain magnetorotational instability
* explain current and past researcher
* starting point = Julien and Knobloch (2010) paper


### Presentation
* 15 minutes


## Report Outline

### Introduction

* what is MRI
* accretion disks
* reference birth of stars and geophysics
* brief history of work
* describe/outline the rest of the report

### Physical Explanation

* MHD equations
* concept of "frozen-in-field"
* analogy of magnetic tension and string tension
* main idea of MRI

### Theoretical Explanation with simple linear analysis

* governing equations
* linearized equations
* normal modes
* stability conditions
* introduct non-linear analysis

### Lab Experiments
Seem to be split between axial (e.g. Sisan 2004) and axial with azimuthal magnetic fields (e.g. Stefani 2006).

* 1991 review
* 2004 Sisan
* 2006 Stefani


### Numerical Simulations

* Liu

### Conclusion
Most important
